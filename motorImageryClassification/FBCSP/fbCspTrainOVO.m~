function [featureMatrix,cspMatrix] = fbCspTrainOVO(miData,filterBands, nFilter, extendChannels)
% DESCRIPTION OF FUNCTION
%
% Uses the FBCSP algorithm on the training data to calculate 
% a set of csp filters and their corresponding features on the training data
%
% INPUT
% miData:           Structure that contains MI snippets and corresponding
%                   information.
%
% filterbands:      Filter bank of band pass filters specified in main
%
% nFilter:          describes how many sets csp filters to take from the
%                   matrix from each side
%
% extendChannels:   Boolean value that determines whether we want
%                   downsampling to extra channels
%
% OUTPUT:
% featureMatrix:    cell matrix containing all calculated features of 
%                   band / classifier combination. 
%                   size is [nBands x nClassifiers]
%
% cspMatrix         cell matrix containing all calculated csp filters of 
%                   band / classifier combination. 
%                   size is [nBands x nClassifiers]
